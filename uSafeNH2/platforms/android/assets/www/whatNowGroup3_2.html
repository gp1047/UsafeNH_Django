  * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
  * Disables use of eval() and inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
  * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
  * Enable eval(): add 'unsafe-eval' to default-src

            <b>Reporting to Campus Officials</b><br><br>

            Here is some basic information. You can learn more by speaking with an <a href="crisisCenter.html">advocate</a> from your local crisis center or by reviewing our <a href="faq.html" onClick="myFAQ()">Helpful Answers.</a><br>

            <br>
            All schools designate a Title IX Coordinator. This person is responsible for making sure that once a school knows about sexual violence, it gets addressed.<br>
            <br>
            •	Your Title IX Coordinator or designee will give you options about moving forward with a campus conduct case.<br><br>
            •	Your Title IX Coordinator or designee will give you options about accommodations that may help you feel safer on campus.<br><br>
            •	Exactly what accommodations are available is up to <a href="sexualAssault.html">school policy</a>, the details of your case, campus resources, and the choices you make about how you would like to proceed.<br><br>

            <u>Keep in mind</u><br><br>
            •	You can request confidentiality, but the Title IX Coordinator will have to consider safety of the whole community and school policy.<br><br>
            •	Most campus employees (e.g., professors, RA’s, coaches) are obligated to report incidents of sexual violence to the Title IX Coordinator.<br> <br>
            •	Most, but not all, campuses provide the option to speak to someone who does not need to report to the Title IX Coordinator. This could be an <a href="campusCounseling.html">on-campus counseling center</a> or an outside agency your campus has an arrangement with. You can learn about confidential resources in our resources.<br><br>
            •	Once the school is “on notice,” meaning you have told someone who is not specifically exempt from Title IX reporting, the school must take action. Schools have different policies about how that process can move forward. You can learn more by reviewing the <a href="sexualAssault.html">campus sexual assault policy</a> for your school.<br><br>
