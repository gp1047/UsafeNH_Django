  <!-- Good default declaration:
  * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
  * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
  * Disables use of eval() and inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
  * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
  * Enable eval(): add 'unsafe-eval' to default-src
  * Create your own at http://cspisawesome.com
